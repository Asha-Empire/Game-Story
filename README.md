## Path to the Asha Empire

Around 2100, all fusion reactors in the world replaced with fission reactors. On the other hand, after the first fusion reactor set up in the Martian colony, it increased the number of Mars settlers.

With the developments in the Fusion reactors in 2200, their size was reduced, allowing the fusiun engines to be easily integrated into different sized spaceships. This development has made space travel easier and faster.

Reaching the asteroid belt in a short time and mining, humanity was trying to go beyond. That's why they set up space stations in different places.

However, due to the long journey times, humans could not get out of Mars, the asteroid belt and space stations in these regions.

With the developments in fusion engines in 2300 years, with new engines named the Pusion Engine (Fusion Plus) the speed of spaceships reached from 11000km/sec to 33000km/sec.

Around the year 2550, mankind dispersed to most of the solar system, established different space stations and conquered the solar system with the technologies they reached.

The earth-centered government, made up of people spread over the solar system, was called the Solar System United States (USSS).

But everything changed In 2576 with the discovery of a natural wormhole that appeared near the dwarf planet Orcus. Because of no settlement on the dwarf planet Orcus, they initially thought the determined wormhole was a reflection of the planet's moon Vanth, but when a explorer drones revealed the truths, the USSS navy has been protected the wormhole and wouldn't let anyone get close.

It turned out that the wormhole had opened up leading to an unexplored and unidentified star system after the scientists did their initial research and several drones had successfully passed and returned through the wormhole.

In the first few decades only the best scientists in the solar system toghether with navy officers have gone through the wormhole and set up a space station and explored and searched for planets and then after have colonized the most suitable planet.

Scientists have determined that the reason why this new system and the galaxy has not been identified before, because it is not in the observable universe that can be seen from the solar system and they have determined its distance to solar system is approximately 75 billion light years.

Scientists named this new system as Vita Nova for hoping to new life and its galaxy as Asha because they thought this new galaxy is the symbol of truth and existence.

Humanity, having used up most of Earth's resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing newly found star system Asha. The colonies began to flourish, and all was looking good.

And then, after 100 years at 2692, the wormhole collapsed, how it was formed.

Scientists in all colonies began to work together on very different researches, developments and new inventions in order to communicate and even reach the solar system. But the distance is too long, making this developments almost impossible.

In 2768 Warp Engine invented. The warp engine depending on the size of the spaceships allows spaceships to accelerate up to 1500 times the speed of light. The only problem with the warp engine is that it consumes a lot of energy. But the Warp Engine wasn't enough to reach Earth because it doesn't seem possible to get enough energy sources for that to happen.

The Warp Engine allowed the colonies to move out of the Vita Nova system into other systems of the galaxy. This situation posed a problem. They can travel much faster than the speed of light, but when they wanted to communicate with each other, they were able to communicate at a maximum speed of light. This required scientists to focus on this issue.

Two years later, in 2770, the Quantum Particle Network (QPN) was invented and communication between star systems was easy. Scientists tried to send a message to the solar system, but it didn't help, they probably thought that this technology had not been invented in the solar system yet.

Advances in Stargate technology have given hope of reaching the solar system again. But the situation changed after the first Stargate was built in 2811. It turned out that it was impossible to build Stargates all the way to the Solar System, or even any star system down of the Milky Way, because Stargates were too costly to build and operate.

When the humans realized that there was no possibility of reaching the main system, chaos ensued and war broke out between different planets and space stations. This war lasted for a very long time and in the end, Walter Friessner, the grandsons of former German immigrants, declared himself emperor and conquered planets, stations and star systems one by one, establishing the Asha Empire. Although Emperor Friessner initially wanted to establish a democratic state, but due to rebellions and betrayals he turned into a dictatorial emperor.

The center of the empire has been declared by Emperor Friessner as the planet Novus in the Viridis system.

There is a planet in the Vita Nova system with different kinds of animals and plants. It also has a special energy source similar to Amethyst stone. Its name is Saiantum.
