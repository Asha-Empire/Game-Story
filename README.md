With the developments in the Fusion reactors in 2200, their size was reduced, allowing the fusiun engines to be easily integrated into different sized spaceships. This development has made space travel easier and faster.

Having taken over the asteroid belt in a short time, humanity sought to go beyond. They set up space stations in different locations.

However, due to the long journey times, they could not get out of Mars, the asteroid belt and the space stations in these areas.

With the developments in fusion engines in 2300 years, the speed of spaceships reached from 11000km/sec to 33000km/sec with the Pusion engine (Fusion Plus).

Around the year 2550, mankind dispersed to most of the solar system, established different space stations and conquered the solar system with the technologies they reached.

The earth-centered government, made up of people spread over the solar system, was called the Solar System United States (USSS).

In 2576, a wormhole appeared near the dwarf planet Orcus. Because there is no settlement on the dwarf planet Orcus, they initially thought the resulting wormhole was a reflection of the planet's moon Vanth, but when a explorer drone revealed the truth, the USSS navy has been protected the wormhole and wouldn't let anyone get close.

It turned out that the wormhole opened up to the unidentified star system after the scientists made their initial research and several drones had passed and returned through the wormhole.
