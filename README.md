# Game Story

The millennial roadmap. Almost from today until the year 3029, when the Asha Empire was founded and the game started.

## Path to the Asha Empire

#### 2029...

In 2029, the first moon outpost or **Luna Base** was established. Different companies from the UK, EU, USA and China started mining on the Moon.

#### 2036...

The first **Fusion Reactor** started to be built on Moon to use the **H<sub>3</sub>** resources found on the moon.

Humanity established its first colony on **Mars** in 2036. For the first time outside of Earth, they truly settled another planet. Hundreds of scientists from different branches went to Mars to research and work. Despite the presence of fossils and life remains from millions of years ago on Mars, unfortunately, despite all the research, even single-celled life has not been found.

#### 2041...

Different companies from the UK, EU, USA, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Brazil and China started mining on the Mars. A consortium of US, EU and Chinese companies has started to build the first **Mars Spaceship Industries (MSI)** factory on Mars. This factory will be 99% run by robots.

#### 2043...

The first Nuclear Power Plant with a fission reactor began operation on Mars. With the elimination of the energy shortage, more industrial facilities and settlements on Mars accelerated to develop. The **New Eden site** was set up in Mars' Elysium quadrangle as the most popular location.

#### 2045...

The Agricultural Industry on Mars has caused imports of wheat and corn from Earth to drop to zero. The new generation of sheep developed by geneticists on Mars was able to successfully breeding and live. Sheep farm industry was established. Within a few decades, a colony of thousands of people was settled on Mars.

#### 2051...

The first **Fusion reactor** was operated successfully in the Moon. After this success, the construction of the Fusion reactors started in the city of Bushehr on Earth, 600km north of the New Eden site on Mars' Cebrenia quadrangle.

#### 2100...

Around 2100, all fission reactors in the world replaced with fusion reactors. On the other hand, after the first fusion reactor set up in the Martian colony, it increased the number of Mars settlers. Due to the explosive population growth on Earth, millions of people, with the exception of scientists and soldiers, have succeed to colonize **Mars**.


#### 2200...

In 2200, with the developments in Fusion reactors, they were reduced in size and started to be used as engines in spaceships. It has been ensured that **Fusiun Engines** can be easily integrated into spaceships of different sizes. This development has made space travel easier and faster.

#### 2204...

Reaching the asteroid belt and starting mining in 2204 was considered a breakthrough for humanity. They were building up space outposts in different places to set up easy supply lines between Earth, Mars and asteroid belt.

However, due to the long travelling times, people could not get out of these regions, space between Earth, Mars and the asteroid belt. They've been content with sending satellites and unmanned spacecraft beyond the asteroid belt.

#### 2300...

With the developments in fusion engines in the 2300s, with new engines named the **Pusion Engine (Fusion Plus)** the speed of spaceships reached from 11000km/sec to 33000km/sec. The first habitable space station was established near the asteroid belt, as the logistical problems were quickly resolved by the Pusion engine.

#### 2400...

In the 2400s after lots of space outposts, a few space stations and and settlements on some dwarf planets of the asteroid belt, such as **Ceres** and **Vesta** were built, the largest **Space Hub** in the solar system named it **Galilean Hub**, inhabited by a million people, was built near Jupiter. Then were built settlements on Jupiter's moons of **Io**, **Europa**, **Ganymede**, and **Callisto**.

#### 2450...

Around the year 2450, humanity dispersed to most of the solar system, established different space stations and conquered the solar system with the technologies they reached. However, after the dispersal of humanity in the solar system, some political problems arose and regional conflicts were experienced.

#### 2505...

In 2505, millions of people died in the nuclear attacks on Mars. Attacks on outposts around the Galilean Hub killed thousands of people, and attacks on Earth more than a billion people died. Meanwhile, Jupiter's moon Io was destroyed, and As a result, a very important civilian research laboratory was destroyed, along with its scientists and their families.

#### 2512...

After the Io research lab was destroyed, the Galilean Hub and Mars became allies against Earth. Earth began to fight against the entire solar system, one by one it began to lose own space outposts.

#### 2522...

Earth is almost about to lose the war. Everyone sees this, but they try to endure until the end. They cannot accept Earth's colonies defeating Earth. 

#### 2523...

After major losses on Earth in recent years, Clonex Corp. presented the use of cloning technology, which is the result of long long much researchs. People can insure themselves in cloning offices and easily come back to life in case of their possible death. In war with Mars and the Galileon Hub, this invention completely changed the situation of Earth.

#### 2550...

After all this turmoil and conflicts, in 2550, the people of the solar system formed a union and decided to establish a central government. The earth-centered government, made up of people spread over the solar system, was called the **Solar System United States (USSS)**.

#### 2576...

But everything changed In 2576 with the discovery of a natural wormhole that appeared near the dwarf planet **Orcus**. Because of no settlement on the dwarf planet **Orcus**, they initially thought the determined wormhole was a reflection of the planet's moon **Vanth**, but when a explorer drones revealed the truths, the **USSS** navy has been protected the wormhole and wouldn't let anyone get close.

#### 2580...

It turned out that the wormhole had opened up leading to an unexplored and unidentified star system after the scientists did their initial research and several drones had successfully passed and returned through the wormhole.

In the first few decades only the best scientists in the solar system toghether with navy officers have gone through the wormhole and set up a space station and explored and searched for planets and then after have colonized the most suitable planet.

Scientists have determined that the reason why this new system and the galaxy has not been identified before, because it is not in the observable universe that can be seen from the solar system and they have determined its distance to solar system is approximately 75 billion light years. 

Humanity finally discovers that there is extraterrestrial life, but they have not encountered a creature as intelligent as humans. They found a habitable planet with different kinds of animals and plants. They found a new kind of energy source stone on this planet which they called **Saian** that is similar to Amethyst stone. They named this new planet as **Saiantum**.

Scientists named this new system as **Vita Nova** for hoping to new life and its galaxy as **Asha** because they thought this new galaxy is the symbol of truth and existence.

#### 2592...

Humanity, having used up most of Solar System's resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing newly found star system **Vita Nova**. The colonies began to flourish, and all was looking good under **USSS** navy control.

#### 2692...

And then, after 100 years at 2692, the wormhole collapsed, how it was formed.

Scientists in all colonies began to work together on very different researches, developments and new inventions in order to communicate and even reach the solar system. But the distance is too long, making this developments almost impossible.

#### 2768...

In 2768 **Warp Engine** invented. The warp engine depending on the size of the spaceships allows spaceships to accelerate up to 1500 times the speed of light. The only problem with the warp engine is that it consumes a lot of energy. But the Warp Engine wasn't enough to reach Earth because it doesn't seem possible to get enough energy sources for that to happen.

The Warp Engine allowed the colonies to move out of the **Vita Nova** system into other systems of the galaxy. This situation posed a problem. They can travel much faster than the speed of light, but when they wanted to communicate with each other, they were able to communicate at a maximum speed of light. This required scientists to focus on this issue.

#### 2770...

Two years later, in 2770, the **Quantum Particle Network (QPN)** was invented and communication between star systems was easy. Scientists tried to send a message to the solar system, but it didn't help, they probably thought that this technology had not been invented in the solar system yet.

#### 2811...

Advances in **Stargate** technology have given hope of reaching the solar system again. But the situation changed after the first Stargate was built in 2811. It turned out that it was impossible to build Stargates all the way to the Solar System, or even any star system down of the Milky Way, because Stargates were too costly to build and operate.

When the humans realized that there was no possibility of reaching the main system, chaos ensued and war broke out between different planets, space stations and hubs of **Asha Galaxy**. 

#### 3009... or 0...

This war lasted for a very long time and in the end, **Walter Friessner**, the grandsons of former German immigrants, declared himself emperor and conquered planets, stations and star systems one by one, establishing the **Asha Empire**. Although **Emperor Walter** initially wanted to establish a democratic state, but due to rebellions and betrayals he turned into a dictatorial emperor. Also, the emperor introduced the **Asha Empire Credit** (**___AEC___**) currency instead of the USSS dollar.

#### 3023... or 14...

The center of the empire has been declared by **Emperor Walter** as the planet **Novus** in the **Viridis system**. Years passed and the year is now 3023, but the emperor declared the reference point of the calendar as the foundation of the empire. And now the year is 14.

Imperial navy forces have taken control of all settled star systems, planets and stations, but man is going to new systems and they continue to settle on new planets. As long as it did not pose a threat to the Empire, he ceased to control these new star systems and allowed humans to live freely in these systems because the cost of controlling them was too high.

#### 20...

Emperor **Walter Friessner** died in the year 20 at the age of 92. His daughter **Naina Friessner** took the throne as queen.

Long live **Queen Naina**...
