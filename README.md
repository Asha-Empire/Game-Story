## Path to the Asha Empire

Around 2100, all fusion reactors in the world replaced with fission reactors. On the other hand, after the first fusion reactor set up in the Martian colony, it increased the number of Mars settlers.

With the developments in the Fusion reactors in 2200, their size was reduced, allowing the fusiun engines to be easily integrated into different sized spaceships. This development has made space travel easier and faster.

Reaching the asteroid belt in a short time and mining, humanity was trying to go beyond. That's why they set up space stations in different places.

However, due to the long journey times, humans could not get out of Mars, the asteroid belt and space stations in these regions.

With the developments in fusion engines in 2300 years, the speed of spaceships reached from 11000km/sec to 33000km/sec with the Pusion engine (Fusion Plus).

Around the year 2550, mankind dispersed to most of the solar system, established different space stations and conquered the solar system with the technologies they reached.

The earth-centered government, made up of people spread over the solar system, was called the Solar System United States (USSS).

But everything changed In 2576 with the discovery of a natural wormhole that appeared near the dwarf planet Orcus. Because of no settlement on the dwarf planet Orcus, they initially thought the determined wormhole was a reflection of the planet's moon Vanth, but when a explorer drones revealed the truths, the USSS navy has been protected the wormhole and wouldn't let anyone get close.

It turned out that the wormhole had opened up leading to an unexplored and unidentified star system after the scientists did their initial research and several drones had successfully passed and returned through the wormhole.

In the first few decades only the best scientists in the solar system toghether with navy officers have gone through the wormhole and set up a space station and explored and searched for planets and then after have colonized the most suitable planet.

Scientists have determined that the reason why this new system and the galaxy has not been identified before, because it is not in the observable universe that can be seen from the solar system.

Scientists named this new galaxy as Asha because they thought this new galaxy is the symbol of truth and existence.

Humanity, having used up most of Earth's resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing the new star system Asha.
